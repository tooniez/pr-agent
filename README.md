# 🚀 AI Code Review with Qodo

Qodo now offers a [free tier for AI code review](https://www.qodo.ai/get-started/) to easily integrate across CLI coding agents, IDE, GitHub and packed with feature rich capabilities for high-quality code review for context-aware codebases.

Note: this PR Agent repository was originally created by Qodo as a code review bot and now contributed to the open-source community. It is superseded by Qodo hosted solution with a free tier available to all developers which we highly recommend converting to for a better UX, feature rich and high quality code review experience.

## ❤️ Community

This open-source release remains here as a community contribution from Qodo — the origin of modern AI-powered code collaboration. We’re proud to share it and inspire developers worldwide.

The project now has its first external maintainer, Naor ([@naorpeled](https://github.com/naorpeled)), and is currently in the process of being donated to an open-source foundation.

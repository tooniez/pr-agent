> [!NOTE]
> PR Agent is an open-source project originally created by Qodo, the company behind next-generation AI code review. This repository represents the legacy version of the project and is provided as-is for the community to explore, learn from, and build upon. The project now has its first external maintainer, Naor (([@naorpeled](https://github.com/naorpeled))), and is currently in the process of being donated to an open-source foundation.

## 🚀 About
PR Agent was the first AI assistant for pull requests, built by Qodo, and contributed to the open-source community.  
It represents the first generation of intelligent code review - the project that started Qodo’s journey toward fully AI-driven development, Code Review.  
If you enjoy this project, you’ll love the next-level PR Agent - Qodo free tier version, which is faster, smarter, and built for today’s workflows.  

🚀 Qodo includes a free user trial, 250 tokens, bonus tokens for active contributors, and 50% more advanced features than this open-source version.

If you have an open-source project, you can get the Qodo paid version for free for your project, powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro – [https://www.qodo.ai/solutions/open-source/](https://www.qodo.ai/solutions/open-source/)

"""Shared configuration boundaries for repository-provided settings."""

# Sections that touch host-level capabilities cannot be fully configured from
# a repository's settings file. The same allowlist is used by repo settings
# application and CLI argument validation so the two entry points cannot drift.
# For each section listed here, only the keys in its allowlist may be set from a
# repository; every other key is dropped with a warning.
#
# skills: `enabled` and `max_skills_tokens` are safe per-repo preferences (a repo can opt in to, or
# size, the host's admin-curated skill library). `paths` is NOT overridable: it points at the
# PR-Agent host's filesystem, so letting a repo set it would allow a malicious repo to read
# sensitive host files (e.g. ~/.ssh/*) into the LLM prompt. `paths` therefore stays host-only.
#
# push_outputs: routes review data to operator-controlled sinks (webhook/slack/file). Letting a
# repo set any of these would let a malicious repo exfiltrate review data to an arbitrary host,
# reach internal endpoints (SSRF), or append to arbitrary host files. The whole section is
# therefore host-only (empty allowlist -> every key dropped).
